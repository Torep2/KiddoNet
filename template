    <p>Hello everyone,
    <br/>I go by Torep2 (Jose Toribio) and I am completely new to professional coding.
    <br/>The most experience I had when I was younger was with html and some form of css
    <br/>since styling my Myspace,Bebo,Gaiaonline etc. profiles was the only way to be cool!
    <br/>Recently have been taking Mark Lassoff's Web developer certification and I am loving it.
    <br/>Not gonna lie I entered this field wanting money and found the learning process way more
    <br/> rewarding!</p>
